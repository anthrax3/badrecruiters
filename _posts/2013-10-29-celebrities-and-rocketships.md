*My new client is an exciting startup in the SF Bay area which has just closed on VC
funding and is actively seeking to hire several senior-level RoR coders with 3+ years of experience.
They have already established multiple celebrities as members and are rapidly acquiring more.
The position offers competitive salary, benefits, and pre-IPO stock options.*

*If you are not interested in a possible 'rocket ride' growth opportunity, this is not the position for you.*
